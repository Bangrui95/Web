            <h2 style="margin-left: 9px;">
                <p>I am writing in support of my application for a short-term Schengen visa for the purpose of tourism in Spain between 5th June and 13th June 2025. I am a postgraduate student at the University of the Arts London and an independent visual artist currently residing in London.
                    My planned visit will focus on exploring cultural and artistic landmarks in mainland Spain, particularly in Valencia, Seville, and Madrid. I have previously visited Madrid and the Canary Islands, both of which made a lasting impression on me. I now look forward to returning to Spain to deepen my engagement with its artistic and cultural legacy, which continues to influence my academic practice and artistic development.</p>
                <p>Despite being in the early stage of my UK residency, I have made full financial preparations for this trip to ensure it is entirely self-funded. I have transferred £2,000 into my Monzo account specifically for travel-related daily expenses, and I also hold an international credit card with a limit exceeding £3,000, which will serve as additional financial assurance. My accommodations have been fully booked, and all transportation arrangements have been confirmed.</p>
                <p>In addition, I would like to highlight that I will be participating in London Tech Week 2025 shortly after my return. I will be presenting my personal creative work as part of an international showcase involving art, technology, and interactive media. This event marks a significant step in my professional journey and further confirms my strong intention to return to the UK after my visit to Spain.</p>
                <p>I fully understand the conditions of a Schengen visa and undertake to comply with all applicable regulations. I will leave the Schengen area before the visa expires and resume my studies and professional activities in London as planned.
                    Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any additional information or supporting documents. Thank you very much for considering my application.</p>
